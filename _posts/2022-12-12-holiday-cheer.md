It's been a while again. There have been many changes since my last post.

# No longer doing the IBM course

I've decided that it was a bit too "Watson-y" for me. Though I've enjoyed it very much, I was disappointed as I was looking a bit more challenging. The focus was very much centered on what IBM Watson was capable of doing, and though cloud concepts were there, the actual application of those concepts and the technology was very much a "monkey see, monkey do" type course.

In application of a concept is where true mastery is. Concepts and projects done via monkey see, monkey do type courses rarely stick in long term memory to be useful outside of the "achieving" the certificate with your name on it.

# Changed jobs

Started a new job late August. I am very excited to be now at [Nefeli Networks](https://nefeli.io) as a Site Reliability Engineer. Though I won't go through my reasons as to why I left my previous employer, my new role is one that I have been _dreaming_ of for quite some time. In fact, I'd even say that all my core competencies align quite nicely with the role, additionally all the challenging things in this role 100% align perfectly towards the direction I want to go towards from day one.

Of course, with the new role comes new responsibilities, and as such had put my writing here, and other side projects on hold for a bit.

# The Holidays

Full house this month. We have a visiting relative, and our home is bustling with energy. The holidays brings that fourth, and am also very much bitten by the cheer this year.

Was out last week too on a company holiday party. Traveled across the country for it, and it was a lot of fun. Meeting co-workers face to face, sharing moments with them, having a good laugh is part of what makes this time of year so enjoyable. Perhaps remote work, and not having to fly out to customers every other week has made me enjoy interfacing with co-workers more than in other years.

# Re-invigorated to re-take side projects

Because of my new job, I am now fully immersed in the tech side of things in my day to day, to the point where I'm advancing in my know how while keeping up to date with technologies that would benefit my projects.

Though I probably will dedicate less time than before on projects, I suspect that I'll be able to advance faster given that I'll be using many of the skills needed on my projects for work, and hence making every second be more efficient.

We'll find out soon enough. :)
